HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
It’s the set of rules that web browsers and servers use to communicate and exchange data over the internet.
Think of it like a language that both your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) and the website’s server speak so they can understand each other.
