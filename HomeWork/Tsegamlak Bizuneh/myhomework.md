HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
It’s the set of rules that web browsers and servers use to communicate and exchange data over the internet.
Think of it like a language that both your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) and the website’s server speak so they can understand each other.
HTTP/1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 are the main versions used today.There were earlier experimental or simpler versions, but they’re obsolete now.The versions get better by improving speed, efficiency, and security.
HTTP/1.1 (Released 1997, Still Common)
HTTP/1.1 has been the default for decades.
Key Features
Text-based protocol (human-readable headers).
Persistent connections: Can send multiple requests over the same TCP connection (no need to reconnect for each fill Pipelining (optional): Allows sending multiple requests without waiting for each to finish — but rarely used because of head-of-line blocking (if one request is slow, it blocks others).
Chunked transfer encoding: Allows sending data in chunks without knowing the final size in advance.
Limitations
Head-of-line blocking: If one request stalls, the rest wait.
Multiple connections: Browsers often open up to 6 TCP connections per domain to work around the blocking.
Large headers: Each request repeats the same header info.

2️⃣ HTTP/2 (Released 2015, Big Performance Jump)
HTTP/2 keeps the same semantics as HTTP/1.1 (methods, status codes, headers) but completely changes how data is sent.
Key Improvements
1. Binary protocol
More efficient than text, less parsing needed.
2. Multiplexing
Multiple requests and responses share a single TCP connection without blocking each other.
3. Header compression (HPACK)
Repeated headers are compressed, saving bandwidth.
4. Server push
Server can send files the client hasn’t asked for yet (e.g., CSS/JS for a webpage).
Benefits
Much faster for pages with many small files (CSS, JS, images).
Reduces latency and network overhead. 
Limitations
Still uses TCP → suffers from TCP head-of-line blocking at the packet level.
3️⃣ HTTP/3 (Released 2022, Latest Standard)
HTTP/3 is a major shift — it doesn’t use TCP at all. Instead, it runs on QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections).
Key Improvements
1. Runs over UDP instead of TCP
Avoids TCP’s packet head-of-line blocking problem.
2. Built-in encryption (TLS 1.3 is mandatory)
No separate TLS handshake; faster secure connections.
3. Better for unstable networks
Works well on mobile or changing connections (switching from Wi-Fi to mobile data).
4. Faster connection setup
Can send data immediately in the first round trip.
Benefits
Low latency, especially for HTTPS.
More reliable for streaming, gaming, and real-time apps.
