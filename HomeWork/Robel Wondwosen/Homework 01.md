RFC(request for comment) - it explains how HTTP works, how email should be sent, how urlsare formed, how internet connects computers.
  Why it matters: RFCs are where those rules, they are blueprint of the internet.

HTTP - is the protocol
RFC - the paper that explain the protocol

| HTTP Version   | RFC Number  | Key Features                                                                 |
|---------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HTTP/1.0      | RFC 1945   | First official version. Basic features: headers, GET/POST methods.            |
| HTTP/1.1      | RFC 2616   | Persistent connections, chunked transfers, host headers. Most widely adopted. |
| HTTP/2        | RFC 7540   | Binary protocol, multiplexing, server push. Faster than HTTP/1.1.             |
| HTTP/3        | RFC 9114   | Uses QUIC protocol (over UDP) instead of TCP. Reduced latency, better encryption. |
