# MyGovInsights 
## Overview
MyGovInsights  is a full-stack web application designed to empower citizens to provide feedback on public services while equipping government administrators with tools to analyze and act on this data. By fostering transparent communication, the app aims to improve public service delivery and enhance civic engagement.
## Purpose
The primary goal of MyGovInsights is to bridge the gap between citizens and government by:

Enabling citizens to easily share feedback on services like Transportation, Parks, Healthcare, and Roads.
Providing administrators with actionable insights through data visualization and exportable reports.
Promoting inclusivity with accessible design and a user-friendly interface.
